# Few-Shot Pose Classification at the Edge: Yoga Pose Classification and Enhanced Dataset

This approach leverages a pre-trained pose estimation model for keypoint extraction, followed by classification using a Prototypical Network-based model. This significantly reduces training data
requirements and computational complexity compared to traditional image-based classification methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by deploying it on a mobile phone for a real-time personal yoga trainer application. The experimental results show that our model achieves high accuracy (97.68%) for pose classification over unseen classes, showcasing its generalizability using only a few examples per class. Additionally, it achieves low latency (0.19ms) on the edge device, making it suitable for various real-time applications on resource-constrained devices. This approach can revolutionize real-time pose analysis by enabling faster on-device processing, enhanced privacy protection, and robust performance in diverse edge computing applications.
